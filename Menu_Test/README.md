# Arduino Alarm System Project
## Menu System Workings

Testing of a menu system for the Arduino Alarm System.

Had trouble with the debounce on the analog input. There are multiple physical switches attached to a singe analog input which need to be debounced. Came up with a "best guess" approach which is usable.


## Next Step

The next step is to add in the alarm panel functionality. Start with the arming and disarming.
